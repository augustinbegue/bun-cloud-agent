## What is bun-cloud-agent?

**bun-cloud-agent** is a stateless, cloud-native AI assistant designed to run on Kubernetes.
It combines a Bun HTTP server, a SQLite database (backed by a persistent volume), and an
AI SDK v6 agent loop to deliver a multi-platform chat assistant with extensible skills
and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool support.
