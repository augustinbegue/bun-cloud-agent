title: Using the Agent
description: Daily usage guide for interacting with your AI assistant.
---

## How to interact

You can interact with bun-cloud-agent through:

- **Chat platforms** — Slack, Discord, or Telegram
- **HTTP API** — Send messages via REST endpoint
- **WebSocket** — Stream responses in real-time

## What you can ask

The agent is a general-purpose assistant with access to various tools and skills:

### Information & Research

```
What time is it?
Search the web for recent news about AI
What's on my schedule today?
```

### Memory & Context

The agent remembers information you tell it:

```
Remember that I prefer Python over JavaScript
What do you know about my coding preferences?
Forget my timezone preference
```

The agent proactively uses the `memory` skill to save important details about you during conversations.

### Tasks & Automation

Create scheduled or recurring tasks:

```
Create a daily task at 9am to summarize my RSS feeds
List my scheduled tasks
Mark task "morning briefing" as complete
```

Tasks run automatically at their scheduled time. See [Tasks & Automation](/tasks-automation) for details.

### Email & Notifications

**Note:** Requires email configuration (HIMALAYA_CONFIG) or chat platform setup.

```
Send an email to alice@example.com with subject "Meeting notes"
Notify the #engineering channel on Slack about the deployment
```

### Web Search

Search the web for current information:

```
What's the weather in Paris?
Find recent articles about Kubernetes security
```

### Secrets Management

Read secrets from Vault/OpenBao (requires configuration):

```
Read the database password from vault path secret/db/prod
List all secrets under secret/apps/
```

## Conversations

The agent maintains conversation context within each thread:

- **On chat platforms** — Each Slack thread, Discord channel, or Telegram chat is a separate conversation
- **Via API** — Use `conversationId` to maintain context across multiple API calls

Previous messages in the conversation are automatically loaded, so the agent remembers what you discussed earlier in the same thread.

## How the agent thinks

When you send a message, the agent:

1. **Loads conversation history** from the previous messages in this thread
2. **Analyzes your request** and decides which tools to use
3. **Executes tools** in a loop (searches web, saves memory, runs commands, etc.)
4. **Refines its approach** based on tool results
5. **Responds** with a natural language answer

This process can take multiple "steps" — each step is one cycle of the agent thinking and using tools. Complex requests may take 5-15 steps to complete.

## Response times

Response time depends on:

- **Request complexity** — Simple questions are fast, multi-step tasks take longer
- **Model tier** — Fast models respond in seconds, strong models take 10-30 seconds per step
- **Tool execution** — Web searches, email sending, and external API calls add time

Expect:
- Simple questions: 2-10 seconds
- Multi-step tasks: 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Automated scheduled tasks: Run in background, results delivered to configured destination

## Privacy & Data

All your conversations, memories, and tasks are stored in a local SQLite database. No data is sent to third parties except:

- **Model providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) receive your messages to generate responses
- **External tools** (web search, MCP servers) receive data you explicitly ask to be searched or processed
- **Vault/OpenBao** for secrets retrieval (if configured)

Chat platform credentials are only used to send/receive messages on those platforms.

## Tips for best results

### Be specific

Instead of:
```
Help me with my project
```

Try:
```
Review the API documentation and summarize the authentication flow
```

### Use memory

Tell the agent to remember preferences:
```
Remember that I'm in the Europe/Paris timezone
Remember that I prefer concise answers
```

### Break down complex tasks

For multi-step work, guide the agent:
```
First, search for Python async best practices.
Then, create a summary document.
Finally, email it to me.
```

Or combine into one request and let the agent figure out the steps:
```
Research Python async best practices and email me a summary
```

### Review scheduled tasks

Check what's running automatically:
```
List all my tasks
Show me task runs from the last week
```
