description: How to interact with the agent via Slack, Discord, and Telegram.
---

The agent can connect to multiple chat platforms simultaneously. Each platform adapter is automatically enabled when you provide the required credentials.

## Slack

### Setup

1. **Create a Slack app** at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. **Enable Socket Mode** in your app settings
3. **Add bot token scopes**:
   - `app_mentions:read` — See when the bot is mentioned
   - `chat:write` — Send messages
   - `channels:history` — Read channel messages (if subscribed)
   - `groups:history` — Read private channel messages
   - `im:history` — Read DMs
4. **Install the app** to your workspace
5. **Copy the tokens**:
   - Bot User OAuth Token (starts with `xoxb-`)
   - App-Level Token for Socket Mode (starts with `xapp-`)

### Configuration

```env
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
```

### Using the agent in Slack

**Mention the bot** to start a conversation:

```
@agent What's the weather in Paris?
```

**Thread conversations** are maintained automatically. Reply in the thread to continue the conversation:

```
@agent Create a summary of our team's Q1 goals

  └─ agent: Here's a summary...
  
    └─ You: Can you email this to the team?
    
      └─ agent: Done! Email sent to #team channel
```

**Direct messages** also work:

```
DM to @agent: Remember that I prefer meetings after 2pm
```

**Subscribed channels**: Once you mention the agent in a thread, it stays subscribed and responds to all messages in that thread (no need to keep mentioning it).

### Slack tips

- The agent sees the full thread history in each conversation
- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- You can have multiple parallel conversations in different threads
- The bot appears as "typing..." while processing your request

---

## Discord

### Setup

1. **Create a Discord application** at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **Create a bot** under the Bot section
3. **Enable intents**:
   - Message Content Intent
   - Guild Messages Intent
4. **Copy the bot token**
5. **Invite the bot** to your server using the OAuth2 URL generator:
   - Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Permissions: `Read Messages`, `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`

### Configuration

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=your-app-id
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
```

### Using the agent in Discord

**Mention the bot** in any channel:

```
@agent Help me debug this error: <paste error>
```

**Direct messages** work:

```
DM to @agent: What's on my schedule today?
```

**Channel conversations**: Like Slack, Discord threads maintain context automatically.

### Discord tips

- The agent responds to mentions in any channel it has access to
- Use threads to keep long conversations organized
- The bot shows as "typing..." while working

---

## Telegram

### Setup

1. **Create a bot** by messaging [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. **Copy the bot token** from BotFather
4. **Optional secret token** for webhook security (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`)

### Configuration

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
TELEGRAM_SECRET_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```

### Using the agent in Telegram

**Direct message the bot**:

```
You: What's the weather in Berlin?
```

**Group chats**: Add the bot to a group and mention it:

```
@yourbot What time is it in Tokyo?
```

**Commands**: Telegram bots can use commands (if you configure them in BotFather):

```
/start — Start a conversation
/help — Get help
```

(Note: Command handling depends on your bot configuration)

### Telegram tips

- Telegram conversations are 1:1 by default (each user gets their own thread)
- Group chats require mentioning the bot
- The bot can send rich media (images, documents) if skills support it

---

## Multi-platform usage

You can enable **all three platforms** simultaneously. The agent handles each platform independently:

```env
# Enable all platforms
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=...
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
```

Each platform maintains separate conversations:
- A Slack thread is a different conversation from a Discord channel
- Conversations don't cross platforms
- Memory and tasks are shared across all platforms (stored in SQLite)

### Cross-platform delivery

The `deliver` skill lets the agent send messages to any configured platform:

```
You (in Slack): Summarize today's tasks and send to #updates on Discord

Agent: [generates summary]
       [uses deliver_message tool to post to Discord #updates]
       Done! Posted summary to Discord #updates channel
```

## Conversation threading

### How threading works

Each conversation is identified by:
- **Platform** (`slack`, `discord`, `telegram`)
- **Thread ID** (channel ID, DM ID, or thread ID)

The agent:
1. Loads previous messages from this thread (from SQLite)
2. Adds your new message to the history
3. Generates a response with full context
4. Saves the updated conversation back to SQLite

### Thread lifecycle

**Thread starts** when:
- You mention the bot for the first time
- You send a DM to the bot

**Thread continues** when:
- You reply in the same thread/channel/DM
- On Slack/Discord: All messages in a subscribed thread are seen by the agent

**Thread persists** indefinitely:
- All conversation history is stored in SQLite
- The agent remembers context from weeks/months ago in the same thread
- To start fresh, create a new thread or DM

---

## Privacy & Security

### What the bot can see

Each platform adapter only sees:
- **Messages where the bot is mentioned**
- **Messages in threads where it has been mentioned (subscribed)**
- **Direct messages** to the bot

The bot **cannot** see:
- Random channel messages (unless mentioned)
- Private channels it's not invited to
- DMs between other users

### Data storage

All chat platform messages are stored in your SQLite database:
- Message text and conversation history
- Platform and thread metadata
- No message content is sent to third parties (except the AI model provider)

### Authentication

The agent doesn't implement user authentication at the platform level—it trusts the platform to handle user identity.

For enterprise deployments, consider:
- Using private channels/servers
- Restricting bot access to specific channels
- Reviewing conversation logs in SQLite

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond

**Check that credentials are set correctly:**
```bash
# In the deployment pod
env | grep -E 'SLACK|DISCORD|TELEGRAM'
```

**Check logs for adapter startup:**
```
[chat] Slack adapter initialized
[chat] Discord adapter initialized
```

**Verify bot permissions:**
- Slack: Check OAuth scopes
- Discord: Check bot has Message Content Intent enabled
- Telegram: Check bot token from BotFather

### Bot responds slowly

- Check [Understanding Models](/understanding-models) for info on response times
- Complex requests can take 30-120 seconds
- Check agent logs for step count (high step count = slower)

### Bot responds in wrong thread

This shouldn't happen—each thread is isolated. If you see cross-talk:
- Check SQLite for duplicate thread IDs
- Restart the agent to clear any in-memory state

### Multiple bots responding

If you have multiple agent instances with the same tokens:
- All instances will receive the same message
- All will respond (duplicate responses)
- **Solution**: Use only one agent instance per set of platform credentials
