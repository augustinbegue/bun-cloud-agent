description: How skills work and how to extend the agent with new tools.
---

Skills are the primary extension mechanism for bun-cloud-agent. Each skill is a factory
function that receives a `SkillContext` and returns a set of AI SDK `tool()` objects.

## Skill interface

```ts
// src/skills/types.ts
type SkillContext = {
  db: Database;
  config: Config;
};

type SkillFactory = (ctx: SkillContext) => ToolSet;
```

## SkillRegistry

`src/skills/index.ts` provides a `SkillRegistry` that collects all registered skills
and merges them into a single `ToolSet` for the agent.

```ts
const registry = new SkillRegistry();
registry.register("time", timeSkill);
registry.register("memory", memorySkill);
// ...

const tools = registry.resolve(ctx); // → merged ToolSet
```

## Sources of tools

The agent receives tools from two sources:

| Source | How | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Built-in skills | Registered in `src/index.ts` | Always available |
| MCP servers | Loaded by `src/skills/mcp/loader.ts` | Configured via `MCP_SERVERS` |
